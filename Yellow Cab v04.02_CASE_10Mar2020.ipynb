    "| 5.3a In the next Sheet in Tableau, create a bar graph that shows the average `trip_total` by `pickup_community_area`. Sort this descending by average `trip_total`. Next, exclude null values (null for `pickup_community_area`) and any `pickup_community_area` with average revenue below the average. Using a caption on that same sheet, describe what you see and learn. Specifically, the `pickup_community_area` numbers are real locations in Chicago. Where are the top three locations? What do we learn from this? |\n",

    "| 5.3c The beauty of Tableau is the ability to quickly and easily visualize what is happening. In the next sheet in Tableau, use `pickup_centroid_longitude` and `pickup_centriod_lattitude` to examine average `trip_total` and `tips`. Using a caption on that same sheet, describe what you see and learn. Hint 1: Move average `trip_total` and `tips` to color and size on the Marks area. |\n",
    "| 5.3d Let’s make this even more useful. Duplicate the Sheet you just finished and add a filter for `hour` and `day of the week`. Toggle through these several times (looking at different hour and day of week combinations) to see what else you can learn. Also, add a “Map Data Layer”. Pick one that helps you learn more about what is going on. Using a caption on that same sheet, describe what you see and learn. |"

The variable `credit` will need to be created. This variable takes a \"1\" if the transaction was on a credit card and a \"0\" otherwise. The variable is categorical rather than continuous and thus, must be treated as such in the model. That is, you cannot treat this variable as a continuous variable in your regressions. (You could also treat `hour`, `month`, and `dayofweek` as categorical, but they also have a continuous nature, so let’s just leave them as continuous.) For each regression, discuss each significant variable, and what that significant variable tells you (that is, interpret the coefficient). \n"
